    "# Lesson 01: Data Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you'll learn to filter NSW property sales data down to Sydney suburbs only and separate houses from units.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Are We Doing This?\n",
    "\n",
    "The end goal of this project is to create a simple webpage where users can:\n",
    "- Select a city (starting with Sydney)\n",
    "- View suburb-by-suburb analysis of property prices\n",
    "- See how prices have changed over time\n",
    "- Compare different suburbs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why separate houses and units?** Houses and units (apartments) are fundamentally different property types with distinct:\n",
    "- Price ranges (houses typically cost more)\n",
    "- Market dynamics (different supply/demand patterns)\n",
    "- Buyer demographics (different target markets)\n",
    "- Investment characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "Users will want to filter and compare houses separately from units, so we need to split them from the start. This separation is critical for meaningful analysis!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Goal:**\n",
    "- Load parquet files from `data/parquet/` (one file per year, 2005-2025)\n",
    "- Combine all years into a single DataFrame\n",
    "- Explore the data structure (district codes, postcodes, suburbs)\n",
    "- Find or create a list of Sydney suburbs\n",
    "- Filter the data to include only Sydney suburbs\n",
    "- Filter to residential properties only\n",
    "- **Split houses vs units** (using property_unit_number or strata_lot_number)\n",
    "- Save separate files: `data/sydney/full_houses.parquet` and `data/sydney/full_units.parquet`\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT:**\n",
    "You will run in to bugs and roadblocks. I have annotated these in my own notebooks with `!#`. Some problems are:\n",
    "- We have data added to the dataset outside our 2005-2025 range.\n",
    "- Are Sydney's postcodes broken up into multiple ranges?\n"
