    "# Lesson 06: GeoJSON Processing (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson is optional and only needed if you want to create geographic visualizations for a frontend.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Goal:**\n",
    "- Load NSW administrative boundaries GeoJSON file\n",
    "- Filter to Sydney suburbs only\n",
    "- Normalize suburb names for consistent matching\n",
    "- Save filtered GeoJSON for frontend use\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You'll need the GeoJSON file from `/final/backend/notebooks/data/nsw-administrative-boundaries-theme-suburb.geojson` and your Sydney suburbs list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You would usually deliver a large file via CDN, but we can use mapshaper to create a smaller file for this project and store it in our public dir in our frontend.\n"
