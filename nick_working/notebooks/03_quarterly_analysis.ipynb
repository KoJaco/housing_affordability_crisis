    "# Lesson 03: Quarterly Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you'll transform the Sydney housing data to match the database schema and create quarterly aggregations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Goal:**\n",
    "- Transform data to match `properties` table schema (suburb, postcode, district, property_type, dates, prices)\n",
    "- Split houses vs units (using property_unit_number or strata_lot_number)\n",
    "- Calculate contract_to_settlement_days from dates\n",
    "- Add quarter information (year, quarter, quarter_start) from settlement_date\n",
    "- Create quarterly aggregations per suburb (num_sales, median/mean/min/max prices, percentiles, contract-to-settlement metrics)\n",
    "- Calculate derived metrics (fast_settlements_percentage, liquidity_score)\n",
    "- Prepare data for `suburb_quarterly` table structure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference:** Check `src/db/schema.sql` for the exact table structure you need to match.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:**\n",
    "- I made a mistake with liquidity score. It's meaningless as we don't have listing date... we have contract / settlement date. We need listing for liquidity."
