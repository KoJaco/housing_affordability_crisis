    "In this lesson, you'll explore the filtered Sydney property data with visualizations and summary statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Goal:**\n",
    "- Load the filtered Sydney data from `data/sydney/full.parquet`\n",
    "- Create visualizations: sales by year, price distribution, top suburbs by volume, average price over time\n",
    "- Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, min, max prices)\n",
    "- Explore geographic coverage (unique suburbs, postcodes, districts)\n",
    "- Understand data quality and completeness\n"

    "# Load filtered Sydney data from parquet file\n",
    "# You can load either:\n",
    "# - Option A: Combined file (data/sydney/full.parquet) if you saved it\n",
    "# - Option B: Both separate files (full_houses.parquet and full_units.parquet) and combine them\n",
    "# Hints:\n",
    "# - Load from data/sydney/full.parquet (or load both house/unit files and concat)\n",
    "# - Check if file exists first\n",
    "# - Try fastparquet engine, fall back to default if needed\n",
    "# - Print: number of records, date range, DataFrame shape, number of columns\n",
    "# - If loading separate files, you might want to add a property_type column before combining\n"
